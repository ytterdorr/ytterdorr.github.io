# ARDataVis

This is the Code for my Bachelor's project about datavisualization with Autmented Reality.

The AR part is built off of examples created by Lee Stemkoski: https://github.com/stemkoski
Which in turn are based on the AR.js library and examples created by Jerome Etienne: https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/

Datasets are from Gapminder, https://www.gapminder.org/data/
