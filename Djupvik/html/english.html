          <h2>Port of Djupvik</h2>
          <p>
            The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very
            close to the beautiful smaller island Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the
            port is a small and charming fishing-village which, during summer,
            comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz.
          </p>
          <p>
            Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupvik
            Hotel, with modern standard and with its own popular restaurant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both the port and the fishing village have a beautiful view of two
            popular bird islands called “Lilla Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly
            beautiful and invites to nice scenery and views on foot, by bike or
            by car.
          </p>
          <p>
            North, and connected to the port, is a small sandy beach which is
            well soothed for a nice swim.
          </p>
          <p>
            The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles
            and it is about twice as long to Stora Karlsö (4nm).
          </p>
